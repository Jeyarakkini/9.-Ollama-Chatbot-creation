      "Input devices are electronic tools that allow users to provide data or instructions to a computer. They enable humans to interact with the digital world, feeding information into the system for processing, storage, or display. Key examples of input devices include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Keyboard: used for typing commands, writing documents, and communicating through email or chat.\n",
      "* Mouse: employed for pointing and clicking on graphical user interfaces (GUIs), selecting options, and navigating menus.\n",
      "* Scanner: capable of capturing images from physical sources such as paper documents, photos, or objects, converting them into digital formats.\n",
      "* Webcam: captures live video feed, allowing users to engage in video conferencing, take selfies, or record video messages.\n",
      "* Microphone: converts spoken words or sounds into digital signals, facilitating voice-to-text functionality, online meetings, or voice commands.\n",

      "Weaknesses/Missing points:\n",

      "* The answer lacks a clear definition or explanation of what input devices are. This would have earned an additional mark if included.\n",
      "* There is no mention of other types of input devices beyond keyboard, mouse, and joystick (e.g., scanner, webcam, microphone). While the student has provided some examples, they could have expanded their response to cover a broader range.\n",

      "How to improve:\n",
